# NatronForNewbies
An ebook written using groff (GNU Roff) for how to use natron for compositing and film. You just need groff installed to generate the output PDF document.
I picked roff because of simplicity, ease of use, historical significance, and partially for nostalgia value. I'm only going to support
PDF output because juggling multiple is a headache.

# Building
Just run `groff -Tpdf -ms -p -s natronfornewbies.ms > NameOfOutputDoc.pdf` and it will generate the PDF document.
