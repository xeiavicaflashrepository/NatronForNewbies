# NatronForNewbies
A textbook I'm writing to show you how to effectively use natron, a free compositing application modeled after nuke. While docs and YouTube videos exist, I wanted something more customed tailored to book form with more verbose examples on how you can make the most out of natron. My book is under the CC BY-SA 4.0 International license.
