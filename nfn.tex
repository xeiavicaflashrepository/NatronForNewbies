% I had to do a few workaround to ensure the title page was blank

\chapter{What Is Natron?}
Welcome aboard, natron is very powerful but takes a bit of learning to
fully utilize. This chapter is about introducing you to the program.
\bigbreak
Natron is a GPL-2.0 licensed visual effect compositor that is very similar to nuke. If you've used nuke, you'll get the hang of natron very quickly. But this document is not just for those wanting to get up to speed with natron if already familiar with nuke. It's also for those who are used to after effects or even have never done compositing before. It really is just a few fundamentals to understand, because they flow between other programs considerably.

\part{Extending Natron}
% Part two will be to how to use languages such as python or GLSL
% to extend natron further should you desire to.
