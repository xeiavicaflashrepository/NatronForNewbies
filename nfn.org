* Introduction
Natron is a vfx compositor designed to be very similar to nuke, which is also
a compositor for visual effects. If you've ever used nuke, you'll get the hang
of natron very quickly.

of what you're creating, the bottom left are the nodes being used, and the
right panels are the settings for each node.

Now, what is a node? A node is a building block (imagine it like lego) that
lets you put together pieces for composition.
