<p>This is a very rough draft and thus formatting will be ignored
until later.</p>

<p>What is natron?</p>
<p>Natron is a free, libre (Open Source) GPL-2.0 licensed compositing program
for creation of visual effects. It is intended to be modeled very much
after nuke.</p>

<img src="./imgs/Natron.png" width=900px height=900px></img>
<p>Here is a screenshot of natron in action. You'll notice a few things:<br>
<ol>
<li>Shortcuts to the far left.</li>
<li>Upper left is a preview of your results.</li>
<li>Bottom left is the nodes work area.</li>
<li>And to the right, are properties for each node being used.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, what is a node? A node can be describe as like a LEGO brick.
You connect each node to various input and output ports to achieve results.
It's very different from After Effects which is layer based.<br>
In my opinion, nodes are far more flexible than layers.</p>

<p>This can be a bit overwhelming how to organize nodes, but it's not as bad
as it appears.</p>

<p>I strongly encourage you when using natron, to import as an image sequence
because the codecs used in the video file can silently crash natron.</p>

<p>Use a program such as ffmpeg or any other program to convert a video file
to an image sequence.<br>
Note that the image format can make a difference. Jpeg for instance, has no
such alpha transparency and png can be decided to or to not include alpha
transparency. Alpha transparency is where parts of the image can be partially
or not visible at all even though the contents of the image exists in the end.</p>
